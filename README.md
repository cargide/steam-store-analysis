# Steam Store Analysis

Analysis of the combined data downloaded from the Steam API and the SteamSpy API.
Based loosely on the work of Nik Davis (https://github.com/nik-davis/steam-data-science-project)

## Structure
The work is divided into different notebooks that require the files created on the previous notebook.

### 1 - Download
Scripts created to fetch the data from the two APIs mentioned: Steam and SteamSpy.
Limited to 35000 rows due to time constraints (Steam API requires a lot of time).

### 2 - Cleanup
Fixing the values to homogenize both dataset and merge them.

### 3 - Processing
Analying the data to remove information that will not be used.

### 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis (WIP)
Please refer to the Tableau link to see a preliminary analysis (just the plots)

### 5 - Hypothesis testing
I want to test if RPG games that are free have more than 500 positive reviews using a two tailed test.

### Extra - Tableau plotting
